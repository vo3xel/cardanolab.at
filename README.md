Cardanolab runs a Cardano stake pool built with love in Austria.

The relay is hosted on Microsoft Azure to ensure a high reliability and availibility. The block producer is running on a dedicated server located in Austria. A state-of-the-art firewall protects the stake pool from being attacked.

## Costs

We are starting the service with 0% relative fee until 01.01.2021. Then we will adust the factor between 0% - 2% to have a resonable fee. We guarantee that the relative fee will NEVER exceed 2%.

## Relay node status

The current status and the uptime of the relay node can be checked online: [relay node online status](https://status.cardanolab.at/)
