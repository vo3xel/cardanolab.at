Cardanolab runs a haskell stake pool for the MAINNET.

The stake pool is hosted on Microsoft Azure to ensure a high reliability and availibility. The stake pool is running on a Virtual Machine (VM) with 2 CPUs and 8 GB RAM with Premium SSD. A state-of-the-art firewall protects the stake pool from being attacked.
